# Python-Number-Theory-Concepts
These are some of my number theory programming assignments.

The main purpose of these assignments is to learn to implement some number theory algorithms and learn how we can use them with big data.

Number theory has important applications in computer organization and security, coding and cryptography, random number generation, hash functions, and graphics. Conversely, number theorists use computers in factoring large integers, determining primes, testing conjectures, and solving other problems.

## üìù Rules

- The algorithms should deal with large integers for Big Data (around 300 - 600 digits).
<br>
<br>

## üíª Supported operations
-   `Sieve of Eratosthenes`: Sieve if Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers within a range.<br>
(for more information about the algorithm check out my [Sieve-of-Eratosthenes](https://github.com/M-Alhassan/Sieve-of-Eratosthenes-Algorithm-Test) page on github)

- `Euclidean's Algorithm`: Euclidean's algorithms is an algorithm to calculate the greatest common factor (GCD) of two numbers recursively.
<br>

    ```
    a =  b * q + r
    b = r * q1 * r1
    r = r1 * q2 + r2
    ...
    continue till the remainder is 0.
    The previous remainder will be the GCD.
    ```

- `Fermat's Little Theorem`: FLT algorithm is the most efficient alorithm to check the primality of a number (checks if a number is prime).
<br>
This algorithm is best for large integers.
<br>
<br>
FLT states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a <sup>p</sup> ‚Äì a is an integer multiple of p. 
<br>
<br>
Here p is a prime number: 
<br>
a<sup>p</sup> ‚â° a (mod p)
<br>
<br>
